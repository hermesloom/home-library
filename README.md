# home-library

*Create your own library with a few clicks!*

Have some cool books at home *and* want to meet people who are into the same stuff? Create your own library with a few clicks!

home-library is a web-based platform for creating hyperlocal libraries, "the library in your living room", with the intention of allowing individuals to build community by

- more effectively communicating "who they are" by more easily conveying their taste in books, and
- meeting up in real life for borrowing and giving back books.

home-library is a "headless social media platform". This means that, even though it aims to connect people *and* contains a login system, it contains no user profiles (i.e. no "heads"/profile pictures of users).

## TODOs

- minimalist login system (NOT based on Supabase!)
  - thus based on fly.io!
- allow sections of books (e.g. Henophilia-Abteilung, Heinrich-Porth-Abteilung)
- mobile-first
