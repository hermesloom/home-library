Replace everything by a neat, mobile-first page which shows a basic heading, then very short instructions for the page: This is a private library which intends to launch a movement of privately owned, unofficial libraries, which exist so that likeminded people can get to know each other more easily and to thus build community. And if someone would like to lend out a book, they shall contact library@luttmissen.org.

Then it should display a simple list of books. Each book should have a thumbnail, an author, a year (optional). When clicking on it, a modal shall open (defined in a separate file) which displays the book's details again and where the user can swipe through all preview pictures.

Style everything like an enhanced, shadcn-based PWA with crisp, modern, minimalist, elegant UIs and vivid and clear and stunningly, sharply, joyfully, exhileratingly beautiful.
